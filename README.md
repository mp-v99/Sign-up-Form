# Sign-up-Form

Hey there! 👋

It’s been a while since my last project — work, life, and 16 full HTML/CSS lessons got in the way. 

While some of those lessons felt a bit tedious or repetitive at times, they’ve taught me a great deal — from accessibility, user experience, and professional polish, to how to build layouts like a front-end boss. 💻✨

💡 What This Project Is About

This project is the culmination of everything I’ve learned up to now — specifically focusing on HTML forms.

It may seem simple on the surface, but behind this form is a treasure trove of:

input types and attributes

Accessibility considerations (ARIA, required fields, label associations)

Styling notoriously stubborn elements like <select>, <input type="range">, or <date>

Using pseudo-classes like :valid / :invalid

Font importing, normalization, and responsive layouts

🎯 My Personal Goal for This Project

This project isn’t just “build a form.”
Instead, I'm deliberately applying at least one concept from every previous lesson in Intermediate HTML & CSS — as a checklist and proof of what I’ve actually internalized.

Think of it like a form-fueled montage of skills:

✅ CSS normalization

✅ Relative vs absolute units

✅ Font imports and usage

✅ CSS functions (like clamp() or calc())

✅ Semantic HTML

✅ Validation attributes (required, pattern, min, max, etc.)

✅ Layout and positioning with flex, grid, and absolute

✅ Pseudo-selectors and focus/validation styles


🧠 Why This Matters

A big chunk of the Intermediate course (about the first 69%) is quite dense — but you don’t really get to use most of it in a project until now.

So, I’m treating this project as:

🔁 A review of the key concepts I might’ve missed or skimmed

📚 A resource list I can reuse and revisit

🤝 A bit of help for other TOP students trying to make sense of how everything fits together

🤝 For Fellow Odins
If you're a fellow TOP student — hi! 

I hope this README (and the project) helps you reflect, build, and revisit key ideas.
